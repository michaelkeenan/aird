There is certainly something special about biology. We still cannot replicate many biological systems.

</div>
<div>Consider that current AI systems can do things that would have seemed magical just a few years ago. For example:</div>

DALL-E (2021) generates images based on text prompts while exhibiting what could be reasonably described as “true creativity”

This is “Sprouts in the shape of text &#39;Imagen&#39; coming out of a fairytale book.”

<li>GPT-3 (2020) is able to write convincing articles, generate code based on natural language, and perform well on a wide range of text-based tasks.</li>
<li>PaLM (2022) improving upon GPT-3 and other state-of-the-art systems mostly by increasing the number of parameters and training on better hardware - without revolutionary new insights into the nature of human intelligence.</li>
<ul><li>The system improves upon the state-of-the-art in 28 of 29 tested NLP tasks.</li>
<li>It is able, among other things, to explain an original joke in two-shot prompts.</li>
<li>In code generation, it equals the performance of Codex 12B (which was fine-tuned on that task) while using 50 times less Python code.</li>
