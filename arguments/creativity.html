<div><blockquote></div>
<div>“I don't think AI will be able to take up any job. Somehow, I feel that it's hard to imagine that they will ever be able to acquire that sense of creativity that humans have. For example, they can put together a bunch of rules, and all this AI has a complicated set of rules that are carefully managed together, but they'll never be able to come up with a clever proof or a clever assertion of a statement or a clever insight by itself. That's my feeling. For example, they'll never be able to do like well-known conjectures in mathematics and so on; it's hard for me to imagine that one of them will be settled by AI. You can use AI tools to do a computer search that's been done to establish stuff, but ultimately there is a human being behind that doing. (27xl3_Sam, Pos. 10)</div>
<div>I think, for example, writing a poem, it involves a lot from your previous experiences, and then there is a lot of reasoning involved. So what computers can do is that the creative process that humans have already gone through before; they can mimic this extent. What I'm saying is that it can actually repeat what humans did in probably some indirect way, but my opinion is that these systems cannot do something new, completely new. Probably they can do something new, probably which is close to what humans already did. (9bc70_Sam, Pos. 21)”</div>

<div>Consider some examples of modern AI systems with capabilities that were previously thought as requiring “true creavitiy”, like generating art:</div>

It works with reasonably simple prompts, for example: “photo of a pink dolphin riding an elephant in the desert”. Neither Google Image Search, nor Bing Images or Flickr show anything even remotely resembling “dolphin riding an elephant”

<div>Consider how people define creativity, and some predictions of things that AI will never be able to do:</div>
<div><blockquote>“Regarding creativity, AI will never be able to substitute genius: comprising skills such as the invention of innovative technology and the proposition of novel designs.” (Hiroshi Tasaka, Honorary Professor, Tama University)</blockquote></div>
<div>https://time.com/4960778/computers-smarter-than-humans/</div>
<div>People possess creativity and intuition, both qualities that computer code doesn’t have, but more importantly may never have, according to John Grohol, founder & CEO of PsychCentral.com.</div>
<div>“We can, for instance, have computers mimic creativity through subsuming works of art into a database, and then creating a new work of ‘art’ from some amalgamation,” says Grohol. “But is that the same as human creativity, or is the computer’s code simply following an instruction set? I’d argue it’s very much just the latter, which makes the computer far inferior when it comes to that component of intelligence.”</div>
