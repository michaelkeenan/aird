<div><blockquote> It's going to be extremely difficult to develop something that is sufficiently reliable and has an understanding of the world that is sufficiently grounded in the actual world without doing some kind of mimicking of human experiential learning. So I'm thinking reinforcement learning in robots that actually move around the world.</div>
<div>I think without something like that, it's going to be extremely difficult to tether the knowledge and the symbolic manipulation power that the AIs have to the actual contents of the world. (extra_7ujun_Sam (super cool thinker), Pos. 31-33)</blockquote></div>
<ul><li>If it is necessary to have a robot with sensory data, then why would this be an obstacle to AGI in the long run? If it’s necessary, then someone will create a robot body for AGI training sooner or later.</li>
<li>If many sensors and tons of different kinds of real-world data is necessary (beyond just one robot), then we can do that too.</li>
<li>Suppose the robot would need a 20-year training process to “grow up”, just like a child. That would not be an obstacle either.</li>
<ul><li>The robot wouldnt need to sleep, neither do many of the other things that a human must do</li>
<li>Human children do many things to learn that require only their mind and don’t involve embodiment at all - for example, watching movies and reading books. These tasks could be greatly sped up.</li>
<li>If this is actual the path towards AGI, then we’d just need to do the training process once - and the result could be copied indefinitely. A costly and difficult process for sure, but not impossible.</li>
</ul><li>Also, if embodiment is necessary, why can’t we have a 3D simulated world as replacement for an actual body? The simulated world could contain human actors, simulation of physical processes, etc.</li>
<ul><li>We could also do massive experimentation with the training environment until we find one that works even better than the real world.</li>
<li>Computer graphics and physics simulation technology is mature, and can be sped up by a lot compared to real life.</li>
</ul><li>Robotics AI might be lagging behind language AI. But there’s no reason it won’t catch up in just a decade or two. It just means there’s a bit of an extra delay towards AGI.</li>
<li>Research from OpenAI on Minecraft-playing AI [ https://openai.com/blog/vpt/ ]</li>
<ul><li>In this research, the AI never actually played the game during training. So there was zero embodiment. Yet, the AI learned to perform complex actions - just by watching.</li>
<li>Sidenote: A small amount of the training data was labeled (meaning, video plus keystroke&mouse data). But most of the training data consisted of unlabeled video.</li>
</ul><li>It is surprising how many complex cognitive tasks can be solved using language training only (not even other sensory data, and certainly no embodiment). Many capabilities have been unlocked just in the past two years (GPT-3, PaLM). It is unclear where the limit of language-based AI is and just how much understanding of the world you can get using just that.</li>
</ul><div>V: I usually say “look like what we done so far, can do plenty of things without this thing in the world, tasks we didnt think it would be able to solve”. My crux: What is it you think we will only get thorugh embodiment? Emotions? Grounding?<br/>Many people havent thought about this very much. “we need robots otherwise they wouldnt be human”</div>
<div>Many people have arguments of the form “we couldnt move ahead without this”.</div>
<div>Obviously they could be right. But for those type of people I would say “dont you think we would get tehre? coudlnt we just build a robot body?” they might say “I want this robot body to live t thorough the entire life”</div>
<div>V: only a few people really wanted to use this as a counterargument.</div>
