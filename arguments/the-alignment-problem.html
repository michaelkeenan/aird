<ul><li>Current ML systems can fail in surprising and unexpected ways. <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml' target='_blank'>Many examples have been collected</a></li>
<li>Suppose we have a future “CEO AI” that’s running a company. Their board of directors might give the AI the goal: “Maximize profits without exploiting people, don’t run out of money, and avoid side effects that people would consider objectionable”.</li>
<li>Currently we find it very challenging to translate these human values, preferences and intentions into mathematical formulations that can be optimized by systems. This might continue to be a problem in the future.</li>
<li>Mistakes in goal formulation could be dangerous and have far-reaching consequences. For example:</li>
<ul><li>The AI might optimize for what looks good, instead of what actually fulfills human values.</li>
<li>TODO</li>
</ul></ul><div>Would you agree that highly intelligent systems might fail to optimize exactly what their designers intended them to, and this is dangerous?</div>
