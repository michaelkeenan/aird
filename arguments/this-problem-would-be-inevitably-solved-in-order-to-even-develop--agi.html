<ul><li>Economic incentives mean things are often deployed without being perfectly safe, especially if people donâ€™t think it needs to be super carefully checked.</li>
<li>Before the first test of the atomic bomb, there were some concerns that an energy release of this magnitude might cause a chain reaction within the atmosphere - turning the surface of earth into a barren wasteland. Further calculations were done and showed that this is not possible. However, the calculation was only checked by a small number of researchers and it could have been possible, though unlikely, that there was a mistake in the calculation or the underlying assumptions. https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/bethe-teller-trinity-and-the-end-of-earth/</li>
<li>Current AI systems have significant ethical problems.</li>
<li>Some of these problems are only discovered in production.</li>
<li>Often, it is not possible to fix all these problems (for example, GPT-3 can be instructed to write toxic material despite efforts at preventing that)</li>
<li>It is possible that an AGI system would behave reasonably well in testing but then produce catastrophic results in the real world.</li>

<li>[textblock:technology-mishaps]There is a long history of dangerous technology being deployed prematurely, before the technology was understood well enough to be safe. Some examples:</li>
<ul><li>Radioactive toothpaste being sold in Germany in the 1920s</li>
<li>Early passenger aircraft (like the de Havilland Comet ) having rectangular windows, before it was understood that rectangular features put too much stress on the airframe - leading to several disasters.</li>
<li>The Therac-25 radiation treatment machine which killed several people due to a programming error.</li>
<li>The dangerous reactor design which contributed to the Chernobyl disaster.<br/></li>
