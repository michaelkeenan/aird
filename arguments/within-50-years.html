<div>Indeed, it is somewhat plausible that we would get these advanced systems well before the end of the 21st century. Reasons for that include:</div>
<ul><li>We have been working on AI since 1950. The deep learning revolution started in 2012. This is not much time, and investments <a href='https://venturebeat.com/ai/report-ai-investments-see-largest-year-over-year-growth-in-20-years/' target='_blank'>investments increased massively since 2010</a>.</li>
<li>We now have unprecedented, and unpredicted progress in large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM. For example, PaLM is able to explain novel jokes in two-shot propts.</li>
<li>PaLM has also shown that new capabilities can emerge just as a function of scale, without major innovations in the underlying paradigm required. This was known before, but PaLM has demonstrated that this still holds at very large model size and high amounts of training data.</li>
