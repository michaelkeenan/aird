<div class="page-data" data-page-title="Alignment is easy"></div><p>The alignment problem might seem easy to solve at first glance. However, as more and more people have start research ed ing it, we have are uncovered uncovering a wide range of problems , including s . S ome which of these might not be obvious at first glance.</p>
For example: <li>An AGI system, in order to have general intelligence, will probably need to be aware about its own inner workings and its place in the world. This would mean it might be able to know that it’s being trained, and it could intentionally display safe behavior in training, hiding its true intentions until later. This sounds far-fetched, but is a natural consequence of assuming that future systems will have high amounts of intelligence and an accurate model of the world. 
<p>Obviously, much of this research is conceptual and we do not have any actual AGI systems to test our hypothes i e s on. That being said, a lot of these insights are quite independent of the particulars of AI architecture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the alignment problem could be solved quite easily, it is not clear that the solution will be found in time:</p>
<ul><li>There is a significant resource gap between work on safety, compared to work on capabilities. [copy.HowManyPeopleWorkInSafety]</li>
</ul><p>And even if a solution is found in time, it might not be implemented correctly:</p>
<ul><li> <li>Due to economic incentives, new technologies Economic incentives mean things are often deployed without adequate confirmation of safety being perfectly safe , especially if people don’t think it needs to be super carefully checked.</li>
