There is certainly something special about biology. We still cannot replicate many biological systems. 
</blockquote>

<div>Consider that current AI systems can do things that would have seemed magical just a few years ago. For example:</div>
<div><figure><img src='/aird/assets/images/arguments/AEF3DE56603309886155530EA395EE38.png' referrerpolicy='no-referrer'/><figcaption markdown='1'>Image generated byDALL&#183;E 2(2021) based on the text prompt “teddy bears shopping for groceries in ancient Egypt”. The system generates images based on text prompts while exhibiting what could be reasonably described as “true creativity”

<div><figure><img src='/aird/assets/images/arguments/341480D2BBB75796A367698A9E01B11C.png' referrerpolicy='no-referrer'/><figcaption markdown='1'>Google Imagen(2022) produces even more realistic depictions of tricky scenarios. This is “Sprouts in the shape of text &#39;Imagen&#39; coming out of a fairytale book.”
</figcaption></figure></div>
<div>GPT-3 (2020) is able to write convincing articles, generate code based on natural language, and perform well on a wide range of text-based tasks.</div>
<div>PaLM (2022) improving upon GPT-3 and other cutting-edge systems mostly by increasing the number of parameters and training on better hardware - without revolutionary new insights into the nature of human intelligence.</div>
<ul><li>The system improves upon the state-of-the-art in 28 of 29 tested NLP tasks.</li>
<li>It is able, among other things, to explain an original joke in two-shot prompts.</li>
<li>In code generation, it equals the performance of Codex 12B (which was fine-tuned on that task) while using 50 times less Python code.</li>
