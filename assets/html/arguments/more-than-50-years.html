I guess at least 50 years. Because, yeah, I think there is some level of strong intelligence, we can achieve within 50 years, but  for fully automated intelligence I guess at least 50 years.

<div>I think current deep learning may face some problems. I'm not thinking that we can continue this way or that deep learning is the final solution to general artificial intelligence. But I think in maybe 50 years or longer we can achieve such a level of human intelligence. </div>
