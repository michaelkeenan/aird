<blockquote>
Surely there are all kinds of sci-fi scenarios on machines that think. From what I see in the field of ML, I just can’t imagine a world where machines are truly intelligent in the sense that humans are. It seems really weird.

<ul><li>At first glance, the prospect of generally capable systems like a “CEO AI” seems quite far-fetched. Like all extraordinary claims, it would require very strong evidence.</li>
<li>However, despite that initial reaction, there are reasons why it might make sense to be more open to the possibility than intuition would suggest.</li>
<li>There are reasons to think that this century might be a special one in the history of humanity. </li>
<li>The amount of resources invested into AI is increasing rapidly, meaning that the most transformative AI advances are perhaps still in the future. A <a href='https://ourworldindata.org/ai-investments' target='_blank'>report looking at the amount of resources invested</a> highlights that the history of AI is short and investment is increasing rapidly - meaning the most transformative AI advances are perhaps still in the future.</li>
<li>While AI has been overhyped before, the hype implied by some of the well-known predictions from the early days of AI is <a href='https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/what-should-we-learn-from-past-ai-forecasts/' target='_blank'>commonly exaggerated</a>.</li>
<li><li>In a <a href='https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/#Summary_of_results' target='_blank'>2022 survey of AI researchers</a>, the aggregate forecasted time until human-level AI was 37 years (2059).</li>
<li>A <a href='https://www.cold-takes.com/are-we-trending-toward-transformative-ai-how-would-we-know/#surveying-experts' target='_blank'>survey from 2017</a> asked for ““when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers" and got 20% probability by 2036, 50% by 2060, and 70% by 2100.</li>
