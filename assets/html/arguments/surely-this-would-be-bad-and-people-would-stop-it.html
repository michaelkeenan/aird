<div class="page-data" data-page-title="People would stop this"></div><p>It is difficult to stop something that has the potential to be highly financially successful, decentralized on an international level, has economic momentum, and for which certain segments of the population may resist efforts to stop you, as is the case with AI.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul><li>The difficulty of transitioning the world to new energy sources.</li>
<li>How could Bitcoin be stopped worldwide?</li>
<li>How could all nuclear weapons in the world be disarmed? Surely this is an easier problem than eradicating AI, because all nuclear weapons are obviously harmfulâ€”unlike AI, which can have incredible benefits.</li>
<li>How successful have we been in stopping the COVID-19 pandemic?</li>
</ul><p>These are all difficult collective action problems, and some of them are easier than stopping AI development that occurs in several countries simultaneously.</p>
<p>Consider also:</p>
<ul><li>Policymakers are very busy, and they know much less about AI than you do.</li>
<ul><li>Do you expect them to do something? If yes, what?</li>
<li>Also, would policymakers be able to react quickly enough to threats? What if AGI is being developed in secret, or breakthroughs occur suddenly?</li>
<li>International coordination might be required to avoid an arms race towards AGI. Do you think this can be done in time?<br/></li>
