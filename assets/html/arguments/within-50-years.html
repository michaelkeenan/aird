<div class="page-data" data-page-title="Within 50 Years"></div><div>This seems a possibility. There are several trends suggesting that advanced systems may exist within the next 50 years:</div>
<ul><li>We have been working on AI since 1950. The deep learning revolution started in 2012. On the scale of human history (e.g. Agricultural Revolution ~12,000 years ago, Industrial Revolution ~200 years ago), this is not much time, and <a href='https://venturebeat.com/ai/report-ai-investments-see-largest-year-over-year-growth-in-20-years/' target='_blank'>investments increased massively since 2010</a>.</li>
<li>We now have unprecedented and unpredicted progress in large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM. For example, PaLM is able to explain novel jokes in two-shot prompts.</li>
<li>PaLM has also shown that new capabilities can emerge just as a function of scale, without major innovations in the underlying paradigm required. This was known before, but PaLM has demonstrated that this still holds at very large model size and with high amounts of training data.</li>
