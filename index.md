		<p>One of our main goals is to facilitate conversations between those concerned about potential risks from advanced AI systems and technical experts. To that end, we conducted 97 interviews with AI researchers on their perspectives on current AI and the future of AI, with a focus on risks from advanced AI systems. This collection of interviews includes anonymized transcripts, quantitative analysis of the most common perspectives, and an academic talk discussing preliminary findings.</p>

		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link arguments/introduction.html %}" class="button fit">Interactive Guide</a>
		<p>In our interviews with AI researchers, some of the core questions focused on risks from advanced AI systems. To explore the interview questions, common responses from AI researchers, and potential counterarguments, we created an interactive guide where you can act as the interviewee. As you agree or disagree with various arguments, these answers are logged and display at the end, alongside others' responses.</p>

<p>For those concerned about potential risks from advanced AI systems, we also have several recommendations for <a href="what_can_i_do.html">what one can do to help</a>. In particular, work in technical research on AI alignment is especially needed, and we would be happy to <a href="mailto:vaelgates@gmail.com">talk with you about these opportunities</a>.</p>
