<p> In Feb and March 2022, Dr. Vael Gates conducted 97 interviews with AI researchers about their perceptions of AI and the future of the field, with a focus on risks from advanced AI systems. 92 interviewees were randomly selected from NeurIPS or ICML 2021 submissions; the remaining 5 were outside recommendations.</p>

	<p>I WANT PART OF analyze_transcripts.html to be displayed here.</p>
	<p>I think ideally this part of the page would be a darker gray or something, something more of a line separator but that matches the rest of the website</p>
	<p>Also there's still definitely a problem with sizing above-- change text size to actually small on the last one? I was hacking it with superscript</p>
